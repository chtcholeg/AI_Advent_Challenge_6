# GigaChat Multiplatform Chat Application (Day 5 - Preserve History on System Prompt Change)

A cross-platform chat application built with Kotlin Compose Multiplatform that integrates with GigaChat AI. The application runs on Android, Desktop (JVM), and Web (WasmJs).

## New in Day 5: Preserve History on System Prompt Change & XML Response Mode

This version introduces the ability to preserve chat history when changing response modes, plus a new Structured XML response format:

### Preserve Chat History Setting
A new toggle in Settings allows you to control what happens when switching between response modes:
- **OFF (default)**: Chat history is cleared when changing response modes (original behavior)
- **ON**: Chat history is preserved, only the system prompt changes

This is useful when you want to continue a conversation with different AI behavior without losing context.

### Structured XML Response Mode
A new response mode similar to JSON, but using XML format:
- AI responds in strict XML format with:
  - Question summary
  - Detailed answer
  - Expert role identification
  - Relevant unicode symbols
- Perfect for systems that prefer XML over JSON

### Previous Features (from Day 4)

#### Step-by-Step Reasoning Mode
When enabled, the AI solves problems by breaking them down into clear, logical steps. Perfect for:
- Mathematical calculations
- Logical puzzles
- Analytical questions
- Complex decision-making
- Learning and understanding processes

- **View**: Compose UI components that render the state
- **Intent**: User actions that trigger state changes
- **Store**: Central state management that processes intents and updates state

### Tech Stack

- **Kotlin Multiplatform**: Shared code across platforms
- **Compose Multiplatform**: UI framework
- **Ktor**: HTTP client for API calls
- **Kotlinx Serialization**: JSON serialization/deserialization
- **Kotlinx Coroutines**: Asynchronous programming
- **Koin**: Dependency injection
- **GigaChat API**: AI chatbot backend

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **JDK 17 or higher**: Required for Kotlin and Gradle
- **Android Studio**: For Android development and building
- **IntelliJ IDEA** (optional): Recommended for multiplatform development
- **Android SDK**: For Android builds (can be installed via Android Studio)

## Getting GigaChat API Credentials

To use this application, you need GigaChat API credentials:

1. Visit [GigaChat Developer Portal](https://developers.sber.ru/portal/products/gigachat)
2. Sign up or log in to your account
3. Create a new application/project
4. Obtain your **Client ID** and **Client Secret**

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone or Download the Project

```bash
cd /Users/shchepilov/AndroidStudioProjects/AI_Advent_Challenge_6
```

### 2. Configure API Credentials

The application uses Gradle properties to manage API credentials securely.

1. Copy the template file:
   ```bash
   cp local.properties.template local.properties
   ```

2. Edit `local.properties` and add your GigaChat credentials:
   ```properties
   gigachat.clientId=your_actual_client_id
   gigachat.clientSecret=your_actual_client_secret
   ```

   **Important:** The `local.properties` file is automatically excluded from version control (listed in `.gitignore`), so your credentials will remain secure.

### 3. Build the Project

```bash
./gradlew build
```

The BuildKonfig plugin will generate configuration constants from your `local.properties` file during the build process. These constants are embedded into the application for all platforms (Android, Desktop, Web).

## Running the Application
